# Randomized Optimization
## Overview
This repository runs 4 randomized optimization algorithms: Randomized Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm and MIMIC. First, we analyze these algorithmsâ€™ performance in determining weights in Artificial Neural Networks. Next, we look at the performance of these algorithms on 3 optimization problems: Travelling Salesman, Continuous Peaks and Flip Flop.

Datasets used was Adult data set from UCI machine learning repository.
## Steps to Run
1. Requires Python 3.6
2. Install following requirements:
* numpy == 1.15.1
* scipy == 1.1.0
* scikit-learn == 0.20.0
* pandas == 0.23.4
* xlrd == 0.9.0
* matplotlib == 2.2.3
* seaborn == 0.9.0
* scikit-optimize == 0.5.2
* kneed == 0.1.0
2. Run following files with jython to create the data files
* NN-Backprop.py
* NN-GA.py
* NN-RHC.py
* NN-SA.py
* continuoutpeaks.py
* flipflop.py
* tsp.py
4. Run plotting.py with python3 to generate charts
